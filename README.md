Automatic generation control protocol to minimize generation costs for a single bus transmission system model.

by Ryan Duldulao and Joel Palicos

* **FEATURES**
  1. AGC simulator that combines the physical characteristics of generators and modifications to the participation factors in order for the AGC react on demand changes faster.
  2. A 5 bus test system that was used to study the losses in a transmission system since the aforementioned simulator does not have network characteristics that takes this into account.
 
* **USAGE**
  1. AGC simulator uses python
  2. 5 bus test system uses MATLAB

 Further information can be found in their own README files at their respective folders.
